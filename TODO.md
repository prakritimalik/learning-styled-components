# Styled Components Learning Path

## Core Fundamentals (Day 1 - 3 hours)

### 1. Setup & Basic Syntax
- [x] Install styled-components and setup
- [x] Basic styled component creation (`styled.div`, `styled.button`)
- [x] Template literals and CSS syntax
- [x] Replacing CSS files with styled components

### 2. Props-Based Styling
- [x] Dynamic styling with props (`${props => props.primary ? 'blue' : 'gray'}`)
- [x] Boolean props and conditional styling
- [x] Complex prop-based logic (variant and size props)
- [x] Transient props ($) to avoid DOM warnings
- [ ] TypeScript props (if using TS)

### 3. Component Composition
- [x] Extending styled components (`styled(BaseComponent)`)
- [x] Component inheritance and override patterns
- [x] Named exports for multiple components from one file
- [ ] The `as` prop for semantic flexibility
- [ ] Composition vs inheritance patterns

## Production-Ready Patterns (Day 2 - 2 hours)

### 4. Theme System
- [x] ThemeProvider setup and global themes
- [x] Accessing theme in styled components
- [x] Design system tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- [x] Dark/light mode implementation
- [x] Theme switching with useState logic
- [x] Separate light/dark theme objects
- [x] Base theme object with shared tokens
- [x] Theme-specific gradients and colors

### 5. Advanced Styling Patterns
- [ ] CSS helper functions and mixins
- [x] Animation and keyframes (`keyframes` from styled-components)
- [x] Glassmorphism effects (backdrop-filter, transparency)
- [x] Hover animations and transforms
- [x] Continuous animations with keyframes
- [x] Media queries and responsive design
- [x] Theme breakpoints integration
- [x] Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements (:hover, :focus)

### 6. Global Styles & Architecture
- [x] createGlobalStyle for app-wide styles
- [x] CSS reset and normalize patterns
- [x] Component library structure
- [ ] Component library architecture
- [ ] File organization best practices

## Performance & Production (Day 3 - 2 hours)

### 7. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Understanding CSS-in-JS runtime cost
- [ ] When to use `shouldForwardProp`
- [ ] Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] CSS prop vs styled components performance

### 8. Real-World Component Library
- [ ] Reusable Button component with variants
- [ ] Form components (Input, Select, Checkbox)
- [ ] Layout components (Container, Grid, Flex)
- [ ] Complex components (Modal, Dropdown, Tooltip)

### 9. Testing & Debugging
- [ ] Testing styled components with Jest/RTL
- [ ] Debugging styled-components in DevTools
- [ ] Snapshot testing for styles
- [ ] Visual regression testing considerations

## Advanced Concepts (Future)

### 10. Server-Side Rendering
- [ ] SSR with styled-components (Next.js integration)
- [ ] Hydration considerations
- [ ] Critical CSS extraction

### 11. Migration Strategies
- [ ] Migrating from CSS/SCSS to styled-components
- [ ] Coexistence with other styling solutions
- [ ] Incremental adoption patterns

### 12. Ecosystem & Alternatives
- [ ] Emotion vs styled-components comparison
- [ ] When to choose CSS-in-JS vs CSS modules
- [ ] Tailwind CSS + styled-components hybrid approach
